# Parking Slot Allotment System

### Parking Slot Allotment System [Lemondrop Technologies: Final Project]

#### Problem: 

You were hired by XYZ Corp. to implement a parking allocation system for their new malling complex, the Object-Oriented Mall.
The new parking system will pre-assign a slot for every vehicle coming into the complex. No vehicle can freely choose a parking
slot and no vehicle is reserved or assigned a slot until they arrive at the entry point of the complex. The system must assign
a parking slot the satisfies the following constraints:

1. There are initially three (3) entry points, and can be no less than three (3), leading into the parking complex. A vehicle
  must be assigned a possible and available slot closest to the parking entrance. The mall can decide to add new entrances later.

2. There are three types of vehicles: small (S), medium (M) and large (L),
  and there are three types or parking slots: small (SP), medium (MP) and large (LP).

  - S vehicles can park in SP, MP and LP parking spaces;
  - M vehicles can park in MP and LP parking spaces; and
  - L vehicles can park only in LP parking spaces.
